# MedGen-Team-Upscale
Problem statement: 

The present health insurance is very time-consuming. It includes a lot of document exchange either in the form of mails,fax or in person. This means anyone can easily manipulate the documents and tamper with it.

Objective: 

Our objective is to build a secured web application which would make the insurance claiming process easier and more transparent. 

Solution: 

We created a web application "MedGen" using blockchain with the help of ethereum. 

What is blockchain?

As we all know block chain is a system of recording information in a way that makes it difficult or impossible to change, hack, or cheat the system. A blockchain is essentially a digital ledger of transactions that is duplicated and distributed across the entire network of computer systems on the blockchain.

How it works: 

Our application mainly revolves around the insurance company, the users and the hospitals. All these nodes are interconnected through our application "MedGen".
Here, the users and the hospitals have to register in medgen. All those personal details will be stored in the form of blockchain.

After registering, the users and the hospitals keep uploading the health reports which are stored in another blockchain.
When the user claims for the health insurance, it will be easier for the insurer to debit money from the insurance amount of the user as all the documents are already stored in the medgen.
All these documents can only be accessed by our main nodes(hospitals, insurers and user).

Technologies used: 
Ethereum, Solidity, HTML, CSS.
